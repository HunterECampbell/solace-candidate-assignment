## Things I would have liked to do

- Add the primary color to the search input on focus
- Add a loading indicator
  - Only show the table once loading is finished
- Remove "Searching for: " because it's redundant
- Hide or disable the "Clear Search" button until there is a search value
- Convert the "Clear Search" button to an icon button that is inside the search input (the icon being an X)
- Convert all UI facing strings to i18n strings
- Fix all `npm audit` vulnerabilities
- Put the table's scrollbar inside the table's body, instead of outside the table
- Work on responsiveness
  - Make the table more readable so overflow-x isn't needed
- Add a search button so it stops searching on every keystroke and only performs a search when this button is pressed
- Add the primary colors to tailwind's theme variables
- Fix the main content's body so it doesn't need a margin-top to stop overlapping with the header
- Work with the backend devs to add ascending/descending sorting functionality
  - Add this sorting functionality to the table's headers to let the user sort the table
- Make the `filterAdvocates` more readable
- Change the generic `onChange` and `onClick` functions to a more specific name
